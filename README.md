# 📊 SQL Data Analysis Project (Data Technician Bootcamp)

This repository showcases a series of SQL exercises completed during a **Data Technician bootcamp**, focusing on querying relational databases to extract meaningful insights from structured data. The project demonstrates practical SQL skills used to analyse **retail, sales and global datasets**, simulating real-world business and analytical scenarios 🚀

Throughout the bootcamp, SQL was used to explore customer behaviour, sales performance and demographic trends, transforming raw data into clear and actionable insights.

## 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated

* Writing efficient `SELECT` queries to retrieve relevant data
* Filtering datasets using `WHERE`, `LIKE` and conditional logic
* Sorting and structuring results with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`
* Aggregating data using `GROUP BY`, `COUNT` and `SUM`
* Joining multiple tables using `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`
* Analysing retail and sales data to support business decision-making

These techniques were applied across multiple databases including **Northwind** for retail and sales analysis and the **World database** for global insights 🌍

## 📸 Project Screenshots

### Screenshot 1: Cities Containing “New”

This screenshot shows a SQL query using `SELECT` and `WHERE ... LIKE` to retrieve all cities containing the word **“New”** in their name. The results demonstrate pattern matching and filtering techniques while analysing global city data, a useful approach for location-based promotions or geographic reporting 🗺️

### Screenshot 2: Capital Cities by Population

<img width="900" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dbeb4e4-f2b3-42f4-a748-bb051716d8aa" />


This screenshot highlights the use of a `JOIN` between the **country** and **city** tables to identify capital cities and rank them by population using `ORDER BY`. It demonstrates how joins enable richer insights by combining related datasets, a key skill when analysing sales, customers and regional performance 📈

## 📈 Project Outcomes

By completing this project, I developed confidence in writing clean and effective SQL queries to answer real business questions. The skills demonstrated here reflect how SQL can be used in retail and sales environments to understand customers, products and performance across regions.

This repository represents a strong foundation in SQL for data analysis and serves as a reference for practical querying techniques learned during the bootcamp 💡
